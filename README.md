# brewtility

A utility library for all of your brewing needs.

## Installation

Download from http://example.com/FIXME.

## Testing

[doo](https://github.com/bensu/doo), a Leiningen plugin used to run ClojureScript tests in many JS environments, is already in `project.clj`.
[Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io/latest/index.html) is used as the test runner, and is included in `package.json`.

To install Karma, simply install the Node package:

```bash
npm install
```

Then build the application and run the tests:

```bash
lein test-build
```

The tests will also execute on the JVM, to ensure the library is compatible for apps thick and thin.
