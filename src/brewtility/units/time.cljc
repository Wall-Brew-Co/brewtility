(ns brewtility.units.time
  "A namespace for converting between different units of time.
   
   In the BeerXML spec, temperature is measured in minutes.
   This namespace converts between that and other units.
   
   Currently, brewtility supports the following types of time measurements:
     - [microsecond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsecond)
     - [nanosecond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanosecond)
     - [millisecond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millisecond)
     - [second](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second)
     - [minute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute)
     - [hour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour)
     - [day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day)
     - [week](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Week)"
